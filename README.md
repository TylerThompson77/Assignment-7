# Assignment-7

The goal was to create a hashtable that overwrites the old value with the new value. Witht the videos in class and help 
online I was able to creat a hastable that took user input as to what they wanted to insert into the table. T_S would 
set the max value allowed into the hashtable and I chose 100. They get to choose where the value would be put. 
If they put two values into the same location then the program will confirm that it is the same location
and overwrite the value already inserted.
